# LungTrainr
Web application that aims to increase your static breath hold time through interval training. The concept is that your intervals keep a constant static breath hold base time while your rest time decreases slightly after each set. Breath training can help immensely with activities that demand physical activity under low oxygen scenarios, such as swimming, freediving, and spearfishing.
